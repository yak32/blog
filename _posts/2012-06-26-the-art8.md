I reached point, where my art skills is not enough to use it in Tarta project, so I am looking for talented artist to help with it. Please write private message or comment, if interested.

And some pictures from current stage of development - probably character for multiplayer (free model from Turbosquid.com). I choose that art style for characters and monsters in the game, but it adjustable in the future.
