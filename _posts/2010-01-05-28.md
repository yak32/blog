I am improving my game design ability, did some brainstorming. Already have around  80 gameplay ideas ))  <br />  I want to have clear picture of gameplay before implementing something.  After 2 or 3 project without gameplay at all ))  <br />  Here is my plan:  <br />  1) raw ideas in mind and pictures  2) design document   3) draft demo with simple graphics and animations  4) play testing   5) final graphics and animations  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> <br />
