To implement WebPlayer I had to implement streaming from Internet. Now it works, with additional layer for loading data.  <br />  Several types of data sources are supported:  1) usual file system  2) zip files  3) files from inet (http, ftp)  <br />  Last thing to implement - installer for ActiveX. I haven't decided yet, how to install it properly - by separate msi installer, or as usual ActiveX, by services of browser.   <img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_LfYx03jjmdk/SGgkmN_3VkI/AAAAAAAAAEE/h7YEz75KKPQ/s288/Single%202008-06-30%2003-15-17-78.jpg" />
