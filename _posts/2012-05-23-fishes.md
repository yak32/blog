I added simple steering behavior for fishes. Steering does't depend on environment, so fishes fly. I used <a href="http://opensteer.sourceforge.net/">OpenSteer</a> library with "Boids" behavior for first tests but probably will switch to own steering implementation.

One more video with intensive movement.

Some additional forces to avoid air and walls should be added later.
