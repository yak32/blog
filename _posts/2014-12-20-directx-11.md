I added support of DirectX 11 to Glow engine, spent couple of weeks. DirectX 11 seems much simpler and better designed than DirectX 9, less calls to driver. Source code now is 2x times more compact than DirectX 9 version. Still, DirectX 9 is supported, nothing is broken.

I started support for DirectX 11 with hope to fix my issues with Oculus SDK.
