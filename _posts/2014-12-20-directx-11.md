Screenshot of the editor with DirectX 11 renderer and simple scene with 2 light sources.

I added support of DirectX 11 to Glow engine, which took me couple of weeks. DirectX 11 seems much simpler and better designed than DirectX 9, with less calls to the graphics driver. Source code now is 2 times more compact than the DirectX 9 version. Still, DirectX 9 is supported, and nothing is broken.

I started support for DirectX 11 with hope to fix my issues with Oculus SDK.
