Little by little engine becomes usable after various changes (as usual it need to be completely rewritten after reading about some interesting idea :)). Last ideas were concurrency, memory debugging,fragmentation and reference counting. Anyway, it improves engine, makes it safer and usable.<br /> <br />  Screen from "Deadly light" demo: <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3d8-iJzS8zk/TW9TdPJFIJI/AAAAAAAABGo/WU1rwarO2qQ/s1600/editor_deadly_light.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 267px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3d8-iJzS8zk/TW9TdPJFIJI/AAAAAAAABGo/WU1rwarO2qQ/s320/editor_deadly_light.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5579770225081262226" /></a>
