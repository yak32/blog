i broke my  brain in search for fresh game idea. It's not so easy, as i think.    <br />  There is one stupid idea - a atomic bombing in details. In first part you will be pilot of a bomber, after that - civilian, escaping from town.  Burning people, death everywhere. Something about how bad is it. Short game especially for IGF. Kind of interactive movie...  <br />  All in real 3D, with details... maybe for IGF in 2D, as they like )) <br />  <br />  <br /> <br />  <br />
