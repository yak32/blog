As I <a href="http://glow3d.com/blog/2012/12/23/leap-motion/">wrote previously</a>, I participated in Leap Motion Development program and was selected as developer.  It's arrived today and I made some tests. Device looks responsible and precise, check video below. I will try to integrate Leap SDK to Glow engine  in near time. It seems perfect for 3D mesh manipulation or shooters.

It's some kind of multitouch without actual touch, and integration of multitouch to for Glow Android port is ready. ( btw port of Glow engine and Iron Cube game to Android is going very well I will show some materials later )
