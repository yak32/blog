As I <a href="/blog/leap%20motion/2012/12/23/leap-motion.html">wrote earlier</a>, I participated in the Leap Motion Development program and was selected as a developer. Â It's arrived today and I made some tests. The device looks responsible and precise, check video below. I will try to integrate the Leap SDK to the Glow engine in the future. It seems perfect for 3D mesh manipulation or shooters.

Unboxing!

It's some kind of multitouch without an actual touch, and integration of the multitouch support to the Glow Android port is ready (by the way the port of the Glow engine and the Iron Cube game to the Android is going very well, I will show some materials later).
