I spent several evenings on rebuilding my website and blog - **[www.glow3d.com](www.glow3d.com)**.
The first platform I used to write periodically about my hobby game engine was blogger.com. I started it several years ago but for some reason decided to switch to AWS based website and WordPress - basically the only reason was to learn basics of html and web site development. Also, I wanted to try it as a server for my prototypes of multiplayer games. WordPress-based blog was bad - SQL database periodically crashed for some reason and I had no idea why. (probably memory configuration). I tired and cancelled my subscription to AWS services (honestly the main reason was expiration of the free period) and closed the website and blog.

To rebuild it I decided to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - static site generator, written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub's co-founder. It's called 'static', because websites created using this technology don't have SQL databases, complex scripts etc. It's fast, simple and blog-oriented. Also, it natively supports Markdown with syntax highlighting for almost every programming language. You basically compile your Markdown posts, templates to final static site and GitHub can be used to serve a site for free. This is exactly what I needed.

Jekyll is relatively mature technology, started in 2008, so it's easy to find templates for a website. I liked design by company [html5up](https://html5up.net/) and it's under [Creative Commons license](https://html5up.net/license). I started from [simple Jekyll-based blog template Jekyll-Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and applied html5up theme on top of it day later. Additional pain was porting of my old blog, exported from WordPress to Markdown but I used some scripts. [This link](https://vitobotta.com/2011/03/28/migrating-from-wordpress-to-jekyll-part-2-everything-you-need-to-know/) is useful to port WordPress blogs to Jekyll.

I used Disqus for comments originally but after [this article](http://donw.io/post/github-comments/) (shortly - 105 additional network requests and a ton of tracking for some shady sites) replaced it with Facebook comments. The website and blog source can be checked on my GitHub account [here](https://github.com/yak32/).

I hope that no exciting new technology will appear soon and I will not port this site to it again.


*P.S. Broken English of the old blog was fixed by my 9 y.o. son, who is the winner of his school spelling competition. Now he is my fulltime editor.*
