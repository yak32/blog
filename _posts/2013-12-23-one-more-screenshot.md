I am running automated tests with Iron Cube - every second some action is randomly chosen - move forward/backward, rotate left/right or shoot. This screenshot was made after hours of tests. The surface is heavily damaged. And surprisingly, there are no crashes or Â problems! I'm ready to upload the new version to Google Play Store.
