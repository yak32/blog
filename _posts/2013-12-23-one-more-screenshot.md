I am running automated tests with Iron Cube - every second some action randomly chosen - move forward/backward, rotate left/right or shoot. This screenshot was made after hour of tests. Surface is heavily damaged. And surprisingly, no crashes or Â problems! It's ready to upload new version to Google Play Store.
