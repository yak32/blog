Here is how I implemented dynamic paths in my engine.<br />First of all I searched available path engines and<br />didn't find any acceptable. Some costs money,<br />some wasn't complete enough. Month ago I saw demonstation<br />of "<a href="http://code.google.com/p/recastnavigation/">Recast</a>" library from <a href="http://digestingduck.blogspot.com/">Mikko Mononen</a>. Library generates correct paths from triangle soup by voxelization. I was very  impressed, so I downloaded it and added support for dynamic  objects.   <br />  Video:<br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/v/V9yTlJaXJSc&amp;hl=ru&amp;fs=1&amp;"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="//www.youtube.com/v/V9yTlJaXJSc&amp;hl=ru&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>
