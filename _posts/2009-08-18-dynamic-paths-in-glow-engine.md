Here is how I implemented dynamic paths in my engine.<br />First of all I searched available path engines and<br />didn't find any acceptable. Some costs money,<br />some wasn't complete enough. Month ago I saw demonstation<br />of "<a href="http://code.google.com/p/recastnavigation/">Recast</a>" library from <a href="http://digestingduck.blogspot.com/">Mikko Mononen</a>. Library generates correct paths from triangle soup by voxelization. I was very  impressed, so I downloaded it and added support for dynamic  objects.   <br />
