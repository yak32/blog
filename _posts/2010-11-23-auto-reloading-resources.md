Scripts, textures, models (by background thread, thus not stopping work), shaders are loading automatically after switching from editing application (Photoshop, 3ds max etc) into Editor. <br />  Also - camera manipulation - zoom to selected objects, top, bottom, left, right, front back view of selected objects. UI for edit assets in external application (defined by OS), opening resource location in the Explorer, import from Assets window.  <br />
