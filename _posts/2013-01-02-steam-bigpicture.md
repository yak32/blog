Finally I became console player! But actually without a console. I became very excited after Steam BigPicture mode appeared. Having big library of games in Steam I didn't play it. It's not convenient to play it at workplace.

So I attached to big 46 inch TV my shinny new ultrabook , received from Intel after participation in <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/script/Awards/competition.aspx?cid=598">300 ultrabook competition</a>, bought wireless XBOX360 controller and launched BigPicture!    2D games like Limbo and Braid are played very well but shooters.. Seriously, how do you guys play shooters with controller?
