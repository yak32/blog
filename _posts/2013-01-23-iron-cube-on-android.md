I prepared a video of <a href="http://www.moddb.com/games/iron-cube">the Iron Cube game</a> on Galaxy Note 2. Movement, shooting and rendering are done, the remaining parts left to do are the sound and AI. Voxels can be integrated directly into Recast navigation library, otherwise navigation meshes can be built from a final optimized mesh (like physics).
