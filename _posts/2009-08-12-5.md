I will upload tech videos from "I know your Deeds" <br />  This one about graphics.   <br />  -<object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/v/vhlBdYBUnqE&hl=ru&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="//www.youtube.com/v/vhlBdYBUnqE&hl=ru&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>  Grass, trees, deferred shading,  dynamic sky, clouds, 3 landscape materials with weight map.  Landscape modelled in Phoshop using clouds filter, altered by   hand for house placement. Grass drawn by grass density map,  one per landscape, trees places on landscape in photosop also.  There is special bitmap for foliage, if you draw, for example,  red point, there will be tree in level.  Shadows by shadow mapping,  not perspective.
