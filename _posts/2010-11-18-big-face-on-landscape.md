Interesting effect, to walk on gigantic face!<br /><br />New features are:<br /><ul><li>import of 3d models from FBX file by Autodesk FBX SDK

* tracing of landscapes by tracing of heightmaps (faster then tracing actual geometry)
* assigning of materials, scripts, audio files to objects by dragging from Explorer or Assets window
* Scripts - editing by Notepad, assigning to object, removing.
* Depth Pass before Geometry Buffer Pass, for Deferred Shading
* Current insertion position, for cut-copy-paste
