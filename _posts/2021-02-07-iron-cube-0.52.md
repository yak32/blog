New lighting system in Iron Cube - shadows are pre-baked on the level editing stage by casting a ray from a voxel to a light source. If a ray crossed something on the way to the sun, the voxel considered shadowed. The algorithm is primitive and was implemented in couple of hours. It costs 20-30 seconds to calculate lighting for entire level.
<p>Shadows look smooth as they are applied on corners of voxels and it works well with existing ambient occlusion and diffuse lighting. All works on 7 years old mobile devices.
<p>Lenses flares are pretty standard - transparent squares moving relatively to projected sun position. They became invisible when a ray casted from a camera to the sun meet something on the way (sun is not visible).
Also, in this release - improved tank physics, heavy tank is scaled, bug fixes.
