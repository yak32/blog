“Pied Paper” – stupid little game about dancing zombies. It’s my first attempt to participate and finish game for Ludum Dare.

**What went right** – Idea to use Fuse tool for characters and mixamo.com for animations, really saved time. It’s easy to make realistic character in Fuse and I prepared pipeline for exporting characters from mixamo.com to my engine before Jam. Also, making game gave me a lot of fun (really, loudly laughing first 10 minutes, when I saw first dance) and it was important motivation to finish it.

**What went not so right**  –  planning (as usual) – I spent one evening on selecting proper music from freesound.org and had only one evening and night to actually write code. As usual, found several weird glitches (downside of usage of own engine). One glitch was leaked to first release for LD ( and fixed in latest version)

This is my first LD, so the goal was just to finish something. Engine is mature now and can be used for next LD. Probably will continue to work on Piped Piper if will receive positive feedback from community.
