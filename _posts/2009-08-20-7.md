<a href="http://haemoglobin-game.com/IknowYourDeedsSetup.msi">Here is</a>  my current demo (~50 mb).  <br /> It contains one level, more graphics than gameplay. I submitted   this demo for Intel Level Up 2009 competition. Try to find  cover before night, close doors, use boxes to build barricades.  Run "best threaded" shortcut for best graphics and "Intel graphics"<br />  for integrated hardware.  <br />  I continue work on game, have found talented artist, implement   networking   <br />  <br />
