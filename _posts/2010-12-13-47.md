 very inspirational reading, Shishkovtsov is smart guy <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-tech-interview-metro-2033">http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-tech-interview-metro-2033</a> <br />  especially deferred reflections - so simple idea to make reflections in deferred shader! just render reflected attributes (position, normal etc) into Geometry buffer and draw as usual.  <br />  also I am thinking about implementation of <a href="http://www.thomasannen.com/pub/gi2008esm.pdf">Exponential Shadow Maps</a> after reading it.  <br />  I read the article half of year ago and have rewritten engine significantly after that. Thread pool was added, engine was detached  into several parts etc.
