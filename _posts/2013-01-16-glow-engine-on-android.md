OMG, I ported  the Glow engine to the Android over the last weekends! (Honestly, the port is based on the Google NACL port of the engine, and I spend a lot of time making the Glow engine truly cross-platform recently.). But anyway, more about it later.

By the way, my new Galaxy Note II is awesome, I will write about it also some time later. It's incredibly fast and loads the voxel scene from my game in time, comparable to time on PC.
