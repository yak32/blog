OMG, I ported  Glow engine to Android over last weekends! (Honestly, port is based on Google NACL port of  the engine, and I spend a lot of time making Glow engine truly cross-platform recently. But anyway.)  More about it later.

btw my new Galaxy Note II is awesome, I will write about it also some time later. It's incredibly fast and loads voxel scene from my game Iron Cube in time, comparable to time on PC.
