I am participating in <strong><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Competitions/598/The-Windows-8-Ultrabook-App-Innovation-Contest.aspx">The Windows 8* &amp; Ultrabook™ App Innovation Contest</a> </strong>and received  laptop from Intel for free after passing to Round 2 - brand new Ultrabook on Ive Bridge, 2 core CPU with hyper-threading, 240 gb SSD, touch screen, multi-touch touch-pad, compass, accelerometer, ambient light sensor . It's PRE-RELEASE, reference device and there are some disclosure conditions from Intel so I can not write a lot about it (and I am lazy to write a lot).

It runs Windows 8, 64-bit. Working on Windows 8 is weird, but strangely convenient  - half PC, half Tablet. New interface is minimalistic  according to new design rules of Microsoft.

Weight is only 3 pounds, it's light and it will be very convenient to use it during travel. More about this device <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/InitialImpressionsOfThe3rdGenerationIvyBridgeIntelUltrabookReferenceHardwareForDevelopersOnWindows8.aspx">here</a>.


First Windows 8 screen.
