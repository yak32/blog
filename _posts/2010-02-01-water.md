First tests with water. It's based on <a href="http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems2/gpugems2_chapter19.html">the article from GPU Gems 2</a>. <br />  2 pass rendering:  <br />  1) render all without water - refraction pass  2) copy image to refraction map  3) render all from "reflected" camera position - reflect camera position relative to water plane  4) copy image to reflection map  5) render water with reflection and refraction map
