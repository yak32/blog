I made first implementation of a random landscape generator in editor. It's based on Open Source (LGPL) <a href="http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/">libnoise</a> library and allows to create random landscapes and grid of landscapes. Later I will add simple editing tools and bump/detail/weights maps generation.
