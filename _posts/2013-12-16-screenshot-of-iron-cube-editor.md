I am debugging some network issues of Iron Cube, Android version. Saving of network data on client , arrived from server,  became very useful for debugging bugs. You can record gameplay on Android device and playback it on Windows machine in Editor and it helps a lot to fix defects.

There is one bug on Android version, when bullet is not disappearing from the scene. Hope to fix it soon.
