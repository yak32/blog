Finally returned to editor development.  Editor UI will be written by Lua scripts.      I started my UI  from simple and usable  source of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/recastnavigation/">Recast library</a>,   For example, button usage:

```C++
if ( imguiButton("Start game") )
	LoadLevel("super-duper mega Quake level.mdl")
```

this is button creation, displaying and logic in one place. After  years on Windows it was amazing!     I mapped API into Lua script language by luabind library, and  now UI script code looks like here:

```C++
if object_selected
	rollout( "Object", 0, 0, width, height )
	show_object_properties()
if  collapse("physics", true, true)
	show_physics_properties()
if  collapse("visual", true, true)
	show_visual_properties()
if  collapse("script", true, true)
	show_object_script()
end_rollout()
```
