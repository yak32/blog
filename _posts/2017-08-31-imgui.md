IMGUI is a code-driven, simple and bloat-free GUI system, widely used in modern game engines and games. Best explanation of IMGUI concept is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1qyvQsjK5Y). The library has basic suppot for layouting (attachable toolbars, layout serialization), themes (colors and serialization), lock-free multithreading (triple buffering).

This library was a part of my game engine, but I extracted and moved it to github some time ago.
