I finally made Glow engine cross-platform, and first platform except Windows is Google NACL - technology which allows to run native C/C++ code in a browser window. I will write about it more specifically later. I am really excited now by ability to run game directly from link and deploy it without any installation steps directly to user (on Windows, Linux and MacOS)!
