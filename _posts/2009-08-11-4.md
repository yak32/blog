Today I finished game demo for Intel Level Up 2009, it costs me 3 nights without sleep. Somethings remain   non implemented, but overall picture is good.  <br />  I will prepare big video and demo later.  <br />  here is small video about dynamic navigation meshes in  my engine   <object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/v/Y4KM32uYOgY&amp;hl=ru&amp;fs=1&amp;"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="//www.youtube.com/v/Y4KM32uYOgY&amp;hl=ru&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br />  <br />  It's based on TileMesh, and fast. Building whole level (300x300) in separate thread in 5 seconds on single core PC, tile size 32.    Dont look to fps, this is deferred shading plus old PC    <br />  here is how it works:   <ul><li>render static mesh, memorize static mesh

* render dynamic objects, memorize objects per tile
* when object moved, add tile of old box of object to update list
* if not moved object intersects with updated tile, it will be added to updating tile
* render updated tiles with objects
* connect tile into mesh (recast lib)

<br />
